# Fix Bookmark Count and Authentication Issues

## Changes Made
1. Added JWT token generation in login route

   - Token includes user ID and expiration time

2. Fixed token handling in client components
   - Added token to Redux store
   - Properly passing token in API request headers
   - Added error handling for missing tokens

3. Fixed bookmark count functionality
   - Added local state management for bookmark counts
   - Immediate UI updates when bookmarking/unbookmarking
   - Proper state reversion on API failures
   - Fixed count not updating in SavedArticles view

4. Improved error handling
   - Added proper error messages for authentication failures
   - Added validation for token presence before API calls
   - Added state reversion on failed API calls

## Testing Done

## Notes
