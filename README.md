# Enhanced ATLSFW Mobile Application ðŸŒ¿

The **Enhanced ATLSFW Mobile Application** builds upon the original app's mission of engaging users with sustainable fashion. This version establishes a foundation for future upgrades while preserving its core focus on user education and interaction through articles and community-driven features.

# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites
* MacOS or Linux Laptop connected to a secured wi-fi connection
* iPhone connected to the same network
* Docker Desktop (installation instructions for [Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/))
* NodeJS (install [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
* An IDE (we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
* A Terminal (pre-installed on Mac OS and Linux)
* Git (installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
* Expo Go App (available on the App Store) and account

## Setting up the database
1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) and login.
2. Navigate to the **Database** tab under the **Deployment** section in the left sidebar.
3. Click on the **Collections** tab.
4. Use the **Create Database** button to create two databases: `posts` and `users`.
5. Within the `posts` database, create one collection: `articles`.
6. Within the `users` database, create three collections: `vendor_info`, `customer_info`, and `user_login`.

The final structure of your database should look like this:

<img src="./db.png" alt="DB Structure" width="200"/>

7. Finally, navigate back to the **Overview** tab and click the **Connect** button and then click the **Drivers** option.
8. Copy the URI as shown below:


<img src="./uri.png" alt="db uri" width="700"/>


10. Open up the `server/db/conn.mjs` file and change line 4 to your own database's URI. Do not remove the `getMongoPasscode()`.
    You will need to partition the URI like so:


<img src="./conn.png" alt="db uri" width="800"/>

### Running commands in the Terminal
To run a command in your terminal, type in the command and press Enter.

## Setting up the app
1. Open up a terminal window and clone the repository using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/sanav33/atlsfw_jd.git```

2. Open the cloned repository using VSCode and open up a terminal session in VSCode using ``Ctrl + Shift + ` `` (final character is a backtick).
3. Create a `password.mjs` file in the `server` folder with the MongoDB Atlas credentials and the private key
   for the encryption utilities (these credentials will be securely delivered to the client in person).

You can use the "New File" button in the VSCode File Explorer shown below to create the file.


<img src="./new_file.png" alt="New File" width="200"/>


## Setting up the server
1. Open up a second terminal window in the cloned repository within VSCode.
2. Run `cd server` in the terminal to change the directory to the `server` directory.
3. Open Docker Desktop and leave it running in the background.
4. Run `./run_server.sh`. You should see `Server is running on port: 5050`.

## Setting up client
1. Open up a second terminal window in the cloned repository within VSCode.
2. Run `cd client` in the terminal to change the directory to the `client` directory.
4. Run `npm install`.
5. Open up the Expo Go app on your phone.
6. Run `npx expo login` in your terminal and login using your Expo Go account credentials (you only have to do this the first time you run the app).
7. Run `npx expo start`
8. Run `./run_client.sh`. The app instance will show up in the Expo Go app.
